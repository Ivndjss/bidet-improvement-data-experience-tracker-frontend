## What is B.I.D.E.T?

B.I.D.E.T is your go-to web app for those moments of dire need when you're out and about, and nature calls. 🌍📍

### Features 🌟

- **Navigate the Unknown**: Use our map to find your way to the nearest bathroom oasis. No more desperate searches!

- **Pin Your Location**: Drop a pin on your current location so you never lose track, even when things get spooky 👻.

- **Bidet or No Bidet**: We answer the age-old question: "Does this establishment have a bidet?" 🚿

## How It Works 🧻

1. Open B.I.D.E.T on your device (we won't ask why you're in a hurry 🏃‍♂️).

2. Find your current location on the map. It's your treasure map to bathroom gold!

3. Drop a pin like you're casting a spell (expecto excrementum! 🪄).

4. Rate the establishment's bathroom: "Bidet Bliss" or "Bidet Missed It!" 💯

## Why B.I.D.E.T? 💩

- "Because every month is 'No-vember' when you've got 'business' to attend to!" 🍂🍁

- "Santa may have gifts, but we've got the gift of giving...you a clean bathroom experience!" 🎅🎁

- "Spooky season or holiday season, we're here for your season...of relief!" 🦇🎄
